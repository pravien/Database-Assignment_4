## Exercise 1 - user privileges
### **SQL Queries**
```sql
DROP USER IF EXISTS InventoryUser;
DROP USER IF EXISTS BookkeepingUser;
DROP USER IF EXISTS HRUser;
DROP USER IF EXISTS SalesUser;
DROP USER IF EXISTS ITUser;

CREATE USER 'InventoryUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY "1234";
CREATE USER 'BookkeepingUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY "1234";
CREATE USER 'HRUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY "1234";
CREATE USER 'SalesUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY "1234";
CREATE USER 'ITUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY "1234";

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON classicmodels.products TO InventoryUser@localhost;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON classicmodels.productlines TO InventoryUser@localhost;
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.orders TO BookkeepingUser@localhost;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON classicmodels.employees TO HRUser@localhost;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON classicmodels.offices TO HRUser@localhost;
GRANT INSERT ON classicmodels.orders TO SalesUser@localhost;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, GRANT OPTION ON classicmodels.* TO ITUser@localhost;

FLUSH privileges;
```
---
* *InventoryUser* – This user needs to be able to *maintain* the two tables **products** and **productlines**, and we determined the CRUD rights would be sufficient
* *BookkeepingUser* – The Bookkeeping user needs to *make sure that orders are paid*, which can be accomplished by simple SELECT rights.
* *HRUser* – The Human Resources user *take care of* **employees** and their **offices**, so CRUD rights are enough to fulfill this requirement.
* *SalesUser* – This user *creates orders* for the customers, which most likely only involves inserting new orders into the **orders** table.
* *ITUser* – The role of the IT User is to *maintain the database*, so CRUD rights and the ability to grant permissions seem enough.

## Exercise 2 - logging
**The users and their privileges being added**
```
 ...
 
 ('12:56:56',
  'root[root] @  [172.17.0.1]',
  'Query',
  'GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.orders TO BookkeepingUser@localhost'),
 ('12:56:56', 'root[root] @  [172.17.0.1]', 'Query', 'SHOW WARNINGS'),
 ('12:56:56',
  'root[root] @  [172.17.0.1]',
  'Query',
  "CREATE USER 'ITUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY <secret>"),
 ('12:56:56',
  'root[root] @  [172.17.0.1]',
  'Query',
  'GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON classicmodels.products TO InventoryUser@localhost')
```
**The three changes to the database from above**
```
('13:13:26',
  'root[root] @ localhost []',
  'Query',
  'INSERT INTO classicmodels.employees VALUES (13360, "Brgesen", "Brge", "x1336", "email@email2.email", 1, 1002, "Sales Assistant")'),
 ('13:13:22',
  'root[root] @ localhost []',
  'Query',
  'INSERT INTO classicmodels.employees VALUES (13370, "Knudsen", "Knud", "x1337", "email@email.email", 1, 1002, "Administrator of Sales")'),
 ('13:13:11',
  'root[root] @ localhost []',
  'Query',
  'INSERT INTO classicmodels.orders VALUES (1337, "2003-01-10", "2003-01-17", "2003-01-15", "Shipped", null, 128)'),
 ('13:13:05',
  'root[root] @ localhost []',
  'Query',
  'INSERT INTO classicmodels.products VALUES ("1337", "l33t", "Trains", "100:1", "Min Lin Diecast", "herp", 3, 70034234.60, 1000)')
```
**One attempt to make a change by a user with the wrong privileges**
```
 ('13:07:52',
  '[InventoryUser] @  [172.17.0.1]',
  'Connect',
  "Access denied for user 'InventoryUser'@'172.17.0.1' (using password: YES)")
```

## Exercise 3 - backup and recovery
The repository contains an SQL file *dump.sql* – a full logical backup – of the entire database, which will create the schema and the different tables, and insert all the rows that were there at the time the backup was made.

In a Bash terminal, chance directory to ```/Database-Assignment_4``` and type the command below to create the database *classicmodels*:
```bash
mysql < dump.sql
```
